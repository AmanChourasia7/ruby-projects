# Simple Ruby Calculator

I put this together on a lazy afternoon back in August, 2021 — just for fun and to brush up on my Ruby skills. It's a basic command-line calculator that lets you do simple math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Nothing fancy, just straight-up calculations.

## Features of this:
- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Option to perform multiple calculations

## Usage
1. Run the script in your terminal using Ruby.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Pick an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
4. Enter the second number.
5. The result is displayed instantly.
6. Choose whether to perform another calculation.

## Why I Made This
I wanted to start small with Ruby and build something useful but not overwhelming. A calculator felt like the perfect choice—it's simple, interactive, and helps with mastering basic input/output and control flow in Ruby.

## Some Future Plans (maybe)
- Add support for more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.).
- Maybe throw in a GUI version? Who has seen the future?
